# The Zendesk UK Police Data app

Zendesk is a complete customer service solution thatâ€™s easy to use and scales with your
business. One of its core features is to manage a ticketing system, where Customer Service
agents can manage and respond to inquiries that come in. For more information on Zendesk,
see this link here: https://www.zendesk.com/what-is-zendesk/

Zendesk allows programmatic customizations that can be built on top of the platform to
extend our agent's interface in a number of ways: https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/

"Sidebar Apps" are a common choice of customization, which support a number of front-end frameworks, including the popular React JS: https://developer.zendesk.com/documentation/apps/app-developer-guide/about-the-zendesk-react-app-scaffold/

This project aims to use components from the Zendesk React Library (React Garden): https://garden.zendesk.com/
to build an Sidebar Support App to make callouts to an external API system (the UK police)
data service to query and render results.

## External API Details
